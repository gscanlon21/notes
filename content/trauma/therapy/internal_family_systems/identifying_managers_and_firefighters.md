While managers help us manage our lives, avoid discomfort and pain, firefighters (once triggered) rush in and try to fix the problem. We may recognize both in how we cope. For example, when life is calm we may plan, yet when hectic or stressed we eat or drink too much.

The following worksheet helps us identify botyh manager and firefighter parts using our senses.

Ask yourself the following questions when considering a part:

1. What bodily sensations accompany the part?

2. Write a few sentences regarding how you feel regarding each part?

3. Write a few sentences regarding how each part feels about you and what it does for you?

4. Reflect on the part and write down any additional thoughts.

It should be clear from your answers whether the part is a manager of a firefighter.
