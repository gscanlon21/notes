A key aspect of IFS therapy if to "find, focus on and flesh out" the client's protective parts and help them "unblend and notice the client's Self" (Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017, p. 93). Once done, the client can recognize their feelings toward, and befriend, the target part, explore its fears, and invite it to do something new.

Experienced practitioners use the 6Fs approach in IFS therapy to differentiate protective parts from the Self and form the necessary alliance:

The trained therapist works through the following steps with the client (modified from Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017):

- **Step one** - **Find** the target part in, or around, the body, asking yourself: Who needs my attention right now?

- **Step two** - **Focus** on it.

- **Step three** - **Flesh** it out: What can you see or experience?

- **Step four** - how do you **feel** towards it? What can you see or experience?

- **Step five** - find out more about it. Be**Friend** it. Learn more about the target part and fevelop and friendly relationship.

- **Step six** - what does this part **Fear**? What does it want for you, and what would happen if it stopped?
