Schwartz states that in IFS treatment, "all parts are welcome" (Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017, p. 33).

The following exercise can help you embrace (and talk to) all parts of your Self using your attention and a few simple questions (modified from Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017).

- **Step one** - focus your attention inside yourself and say the following in your head or out loud: "I want to help anyone that needs help, but first, I need to know all of you."

- **Step two** - then say the following out loud or to yourself: "If you overwhelm me, I will not be able to help you."

- **Step three** - make the following request: "Please be here with me, rather than taking me over. When you are ready, let me know who you are, and I will write it down."

- **Step four** - make a note of the parts (including thoughts, emotions, and sensations) that you feel or experience:

Scwartz and team created this exercise to help the client welcome all part of their Self (Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017).
