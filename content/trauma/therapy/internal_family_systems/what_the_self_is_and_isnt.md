Having used IFS therapy with many clients to explore their Self, Scwartz identified eight Cs of Self-Energy and Self-Leadership familiar to almost everyone (Schwartz, 2021).

This worksheet visits each of the eight Cs and encourages the client to notice the quality in themselves.

Each of the eight Cs of Self-Energy and Self-Leadership is listed below. After each one is a box, use it to note down your thoughts to feel the connection to that quality.

##### Reflect on your Self:

What does **curiosity** mean to you?

What does **calm** mean to you?

What does **confidence** mean to you?

What does **compassion** mean to you?

What does **creativity** mean to you?

What does **clarity** mean to you?

What does **courage** mean to you?

What does **connectedness** mean to you?

Consideration of each one will make you feel more connected to humanity. "When people sense how connected they are to humanity, they feel more curious about others and have more coursage to help them" (Schwartz, 2021, p. 93).
