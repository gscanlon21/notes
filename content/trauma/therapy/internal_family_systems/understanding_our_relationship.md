When a part of the self is identified, it is essential to learn about it in greater detail and better understand whether it is doing its job.

Use the flowwing worksheet as a part of Internal Family Systems Therapy to identify the role and intent of the part under scrutiny.

Ask the client to consider the following:

1. What is its role, and how does it help you manage your life?

2. What is its relationship with other people?

3. What positive intent does it have for you?

4. How does it try to protect you?

5. What is it trying to protect you from?

6. Is it happy with its job? Or would it prefer something else?

You may find as you focus and make notes that your relationship toward the part will change.
