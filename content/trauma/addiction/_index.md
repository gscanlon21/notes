Make sure medical problems are take care of: thyroid issues, vitamin d deficiency, anemia.

The action that you takes, determines the life that your live. Not the other way around. All it takes it 1 day to change. Take different actions and you will become a different person.

# "I can't change"
The part of your brain that is addicted to XYZ, has one trump card to play, it'll convince you that you cannot change your life. The moment that your addiction convinces you that you can't change, you end up doing XYZ.

You can't be on autopilot and aware at the same time. When you are aware, you are able to break out of bad habits. When you activate awareness, you activate more parts of your brain that help with willpower.

You cannot exert willpower without awareness.

Each objection that your mind raises is a task to be completed.

## Embracing Boredom
Live in a single room, have minimal stuff in the room to distract you. Eat in the room, sleep in the room, do yoga in the room, read in the room. Remove devices and other distractions. Turn your phone to grayscale. Everything that can be done on the computer should be done on the computer, not on the phone.

Food is not pleasure, food is sustenance. You're eating for survival.

Notice your mind, your mind will get desperate. If you have good awareness, you will see your mind panicking. If you surrender, you lose.

Embracing fear and emotions is critical to healing and changing.
