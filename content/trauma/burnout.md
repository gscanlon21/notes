# Build breaks — and personal check-ins — into your schedule
Dr. Borland always recommends taking breaks as a good solution to start tackling burnout.

“We have to be able to step away from the computer, or step away from whatever that source of stress is, to attend to our health and well-being,” Dr. Borland says. “It’s important that we all do a daily, maybe even hourly, check-in with ourselves, to see, ‘How am I doing emotionally? How am I doing physically?’”
