Shame is all about and thrives in secrecy/darkness, and talking is a way to bring it out into the light. When we find other people to accept us and the things we find so shameful, it starts to heal us. Shame robs us of connection to others and is self-isolating, so the opposite action to that is to keep reaching out.

# Re-parenting for Shame

All these successful reparative interventions happen with another being (real or mental) that possesses and uses the following four capacities when witnessing us:
- **Reliably attentive**: When they are there, they are actively listening and attended to our experience.
- **Leads with empathetic understanding**: They do not attempt to fix or judge the experience, only to understand it clearly.
- **Soothing and calm when we are distressed**: They do not become dysregulated or reactive when we are dysregulated. Note this does not mean they are trying to make us "feel better". Rather they are demonstrating these states are acceptable and endurable.
- **Expresses delight in our growth**: They are happy you are growing and changing, and they visibly demonstrate it.
