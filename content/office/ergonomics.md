# Monitor
Reflective LCD monitors use ambient light to light up the screen and are easy on the eyes. They require either sunlight or 4000-6500K 1600 lumens flicker-free light bulbs to function. Transflective LCD montiors and RLCD monitors with built-in front lights also exist.

In my experience, monitor lights tend to highlight dust on the screen and don't light up RLCD screens much. It's best to have bright, diffuse, ambient light in a place angled behind you that won't cause glare on the screen.
