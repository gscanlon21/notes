# Desk

# Chair
Don't get a rolling chair if you don't have carpet.

# Monitor
Reflective LCD monitors use ambient light to light up the screen and are easy on the eyes. They require either sunlight or 4000-6500K 1600 lumens flicker-free light bulbs to function. Transflective LCD monitors and R-LCD monitors with built-in front lights also exist.

## Lighting
In my experience, monitor lights tend to highlight dust on the screen and don't light up R-LCD screens much. It's best to have bright, diffuse, ambient light in a place angled behind you that won't cause glare on the screen.  

Diffuser lamp shade covers exist and can be used to diffuse the light sufficiently to reduce glare from bright lights.
