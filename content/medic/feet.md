# Metatarsalgia
Need to offload some of the pressure on the metatarsal heads. Find something to tape or wrap under the metatarsal dome, such as an arm band.

> [!WARNING] 
> The metatarsal dome is back from the metatarsal heads. Putting pressure on the metatarsal heads by mistake will increase the pressure on them and make the pain worse.
