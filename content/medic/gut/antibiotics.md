# Fungal Overgrowth
Treatment with oral antibiotics kills of bacteria that may be keeping fungi in check. Avoid foods high in carbs and sugar until the antibiotic course is through.

# C-Diff
C-diff is a highly contagious, potentially deadly, infection that thrives during or soon after antibiotic use. Supplementing with pre- and pro-biotics during the antibiotic course will help to prevent c-diff from taking hold. Eating foods high in fiber may also help. Fermented foods can help, though they can also promote fungal growth if at risk of candida. Vitamin-C and colostrum/IgG may also be beneficial.

# Gut Dysbiosis
After the antibiotic course, the gut microbiome diversity is nuked. Taking probiotics after the antibiotic course may be harmful because it prevents a variety, thousands, of other potentially good strains of bacteria from taking hold. It's best to eat a variety of foods: vegetables, low-sugar/carb fruits, low-yeast fermented foods, high-fiber foods, high meat foods.

# Oxalates
Taking a course of antibiotics will likely kill of the bacteria that helps digest oxalates and other hard-to-digest foods. Probiotics and other digestive-aids may help. It's best to avoid foods high in oxalates for a while after taking a course of antibiotics.
