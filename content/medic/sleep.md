# Sleep Hygiene
- Stick to a schedule
- Keep the bed at a cool temp.
- Monitor eating and drinking before bed. 
    - Stop eating at least 2-3 hours before bed.
- Notice unhelpful thoughts about sleep and challenge them.
    - "I'll be a wreck if I don't sleep well" = "I might be drowsy, but I can push through"
- Stimulus Control - Only associate the bed with sleep
    - In bed stressing about not sleeping = the bed is associated with your stressing.
    - If not asleep in 30 minutes, get up and relax elsewhere for a while.
- Relaxation Techniques
    - Meditation
    - Deep breathing
- Light Exposure
    - Get early morning sunlight and limit artificial blue light at night to promote a healthy sleep/wake cycle.


##### Spending 5 minutes writing tomorrow’s to-do list before bed can help you fall asleep ~15 minutes faster.[^1]

> Researchers randomly assigned healthy young adults to one of two bedtime writing tasks: jot down everything they needed to do in the coming days, or list what they had already accomplished. Using sleep lab monitoring, they found that those who wrote to-do lists fell asleep 9 minutes faster on average. And the more detailed their lists, the quicker they drifted off, by up to 15 minutes.
> <br><br>
> The scientists believe this works through a process called cognitive offloading — getting unfinished tasks out of your head and onto paper tells your brain it no longer needs to continually rehearse or worry about them. In contrast, writing about completed activities may stimulate reflection and mental arousal, making it harder to unwind.
> <br><br>
> If your mind races at bedtime, try this: about 10 minutes before sleep, grab a pen and paper (no phones), set a 5-minute timer, and write a specific list of what you’ll do tomorrow. Instead of vague goals like “finish work stuff,” write “send email to boss, finish slide deck, order groceries.” Then close the notebook and rest easy knowing your plans are captured.
> <br><br>
> Make sure you don't write about past accomplishments or ruminate on problems. Instead, focus only on concrete future actions. And then keep the list visible to reduce anxiety about forgetting tasks in the morning.

##### You’re a bedtime procrastinator
> **What it is:**
> <br>
> Bedtime procrastination means staying up later than you planned—for no real reason.¹ You’re not working late, taking care of someone, or doing anything you have to do. You’re just delaying sleep because you don’t want the day to be over.
> <br><br>
> Maybe it’s because you finally have time to yourself. Maybe it’s because you’re enjoying a show, scrolling, or just sitting in the quiet. 
> <br><br>
> Whatever the reason, it feels good in the moment—but it comes at a cost. People who procrastinate on bedtime spend about four times more time on their phones before bed than those who don’t, and they sleep worse and feel more tired the next day.²
> <br><br>
> **Why it happens:**
> <br>
Bedtime procrastination is usually about control. All day long, your time belongs to other people—work, family, errands, obligations. 
> <br><br>
> Late at night, it finally feels like your time is yours. So you hang onto it, even if it means stealing from tomorrow.
> <br><br>
> **What helps:**
> <br>
> One simple way to start changing this is to notice and name what’s really happening in the moment.
> <br><br>
> When you catch yourself saying, “Just one more episode” or “I’ll scroll for a minute,” try quietly naming it: This is me putting off sleep because I don’t want the day to end.
> <br><br>
> That small step matters because it interrupts autopilot. You’re no longer just reacting—you’re recognizing what you’re doing and why. And once you see it clearly, you can decide whether it’s worth it. 
> <br><br>
> You’re not trying to “fix” yourself or force yourself to bed; you’re just getting honest about the trade-off.
> <br><br>
> Some nights, you might still stay up. But over time, the act of noticing changes the pattern. The moment you name what’s happening, you stop being pulled along by it. You start choosing.
