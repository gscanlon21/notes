# Washing

##### How to Get a Good Wash[^1]
1. Run the hot water tap to purge the cold water from the line before running the dishwasher.
    - Hot water activates the enzymes that are used to break down food which makes them more effective.
1. Add pre-wash detergent so that the pre-wash can break down some fats and oils before the main wash starts.
    - Powder is as good as podded detergent, though the podded detergent may contain a premium powder formula.
1. Different options on the dishwasher may use a different heating cycle or contain more pre-wash or rinse cycles.
    - Depends on the dishwasher, but different dishwashers may function better or worse on different options.


# Leaks

> [!TIP]
> There may be an access panel at the bottom front-face of the dishwasher that exposes some hoses.

##### How to Fix a Leak

1. Turn off the connections under the sink that lead to the dishwasher.
1. Cleanup any water on the floor and start a fan to get the air moving. 
1. Shove a towel under the dishwasher to absorb any water left in the leaking hoses.
1. Disconnect the leaking hoses from under the sink and absorb any water left in that end of the hoses.
1. Disconnect the drain line, which is usually a white-ish flexible hose.
1. Unplug the electric line leading to the dishwasher.
1. Unscrew the dishwasher from the underside of the counter-top. The screws are inside the dishwasher.
    - There may also be screws in the side of the dishwasher, they have plastic covers over them.
1. Gently wiggle out the dishwasher while feeding through the hoses from under the sink.
