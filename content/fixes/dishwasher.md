##### How to Get a Good Wash[^1]
1. Run the hot water tap to purge the cold water from the line before running the dishwasher.
    - Hot water activates the enzymes that are used to break down food which makes them more effective.
1. Add pre-wash detergent so that the pre-wash can break down some fats and oils before the main wash starts.
    - Powder is as good as podded detergent, though the podded detergent may contain a premium powder formula.
1. Different options on the dishwasher may use a different heating cycle or contain more pre-wash or rinse cycles.
    - Depends on the dishwasher, but different dishwashers may function better or worse on different options.
