# Clothes Stains

**Tomato Sauce**
: Can be blotted out with an acidic solution such as distilled white vinegar.



# Washing

**Towels**
: Use the **Pure Rinse** option to get all the leftover detergent residue off.
: Try adding a ½-cup distilled white vinegar in the rinse cycle to strip out any acidic residue.
: Try adding a ½-cup baking soda in the rinse cycle to break up the bonds of bacteria and residues.
: Never use fabric softener on towels—it coats the terry cloth, so they get hard and stop absorbing.

> Make sure to run the **Clean Washer** cycle every 6 months or so to rinse out the tub.
