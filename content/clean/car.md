# Windshield

> Clean the inside top to bottom (vertical movement) and exterior horizontal. That way if you see streaks you'll know which side of the glass it's on.

##### Cleaning the Inside of the Windshields
Use an alcohol based cleaner so no streaks are left on the windshield. After cleaning, buff the windshield with a dry microfiber towel to get rid of any excess residue.
