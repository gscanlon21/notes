# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

**Idiopathic**
: No known cause.

**Pulmonary**
: Affects the lungs.

**Fibrosis**
: Scarring of the tissue.

## Dataset
- 18,838 genes
- 103 IPF samples
  - 36 from surgical biopsies
  - 67 from lungs removed during transplant
- 103 non-IPF controls
  - 41 from normal portion of lung cancer biopsies
  - 62 from deceases organ donors without lung disease

- Quantifying how much mRNA content (fragments of cDNA) was found for each gene in each sample.
  - Higher value indicated more expression.

**Differential Expression Analysis**
: Finding genes with differences in expression between two conditions.
