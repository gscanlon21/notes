##### How many flips of a coin would it take to know with absolute certainty that a coin is biased (weighted on one side)?
It could be a coincidence that the result is Heads every time with a fair coin, so it's impossible to tell. But, you can tell how big of a coincidence different results would be.

##### Statistics of Five Coin Flips
- Assume the coin is fair (null hypothesis).
- Flip the coin five times, if the coin lands on heads or tails five times in a row:
- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what are the odds of a result this extreme?
  - (0.5 ^ 5) * 2 _heads or tails, check both ends of the extreme_ == 6.25%
- 0.0625 is called the p-value
  - How much of a coincidence five heads or tails in a row is if the coin is fair.


**Null Hypothesis**
: The assumption that the experiment is fair.
: The assumption that nothing unusual is going on.

**Alternative Hypothesis**
: The hypothesis that the result is unfair.
: > The hypothesis that the coin is biased or weighted.

**P-Value**
: The smaller the p-value, the more severe coincidence would be required see the same result.
: The probability of seeing a result at least this extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.


# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
The goal is to figure out if the differences in gene expression are a coincidence, of if there is a real underlying change in gene expression with the condition.
