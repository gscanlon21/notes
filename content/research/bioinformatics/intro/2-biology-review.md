# Molecular Biology Review
It can be useful, though not accurate, to think about gene expression as a 1:1:1 ratio between genes:transcripts:proteins.

**Protein Isoforms**
: Different forms of proteins produced by the same gene.
: One genes can produce many different types of proteins.

**Transcription-Factor Proteins**
_A Form of Gene Regulation_
: Binds to the DNA close to the site of another gene and makes it easier or harder for mRNA to be produced from that other gene.

**Nucleotide**
: A base attached to a sugar and phosphate(s).

## DNA
A nucleic acid, made up of nucleotides. Double stranded.

##### Four Bases
Sequences of base pairs encode information. 
Possible for there to be a pair mismatch, though rare.

**AC**
_Base Pair_
: **Adenine**

  **Thymine**

**CG**
_Base Pair_
: **Cytosine**

  **Guanine**

## Transcription
DNA is read by RNA Polymerase into mRNA.

mRNA is complementary to the DNA being read (with Thymine swapped with Uracil).

**Coding Strand**
: The strand that the mRNA matches (with T -> U).

**Template Strand**
: The strand that RNA Polymerase reads to form the compliment of. 

### mRNA
A nucleic acid, made up of nucleotides. Usually single stranded.

##### Four Bases
**AU**
_Base Pair_
: **Adenine**

  **Uracil**

**CG**
_Base Pair_
: **Cytosine**

  **Guanine**

## Translation

mRNA sequence can be thought of in triplets, where a triplet of nucleotides is called a codon.

### Proteins
A chain of amino acids is folded together to produce the final protein structure.


## Epigenetics
Ways DNA can be regulated based on the 3D structure of the DNA. Useful for cell differentiation from stem cell.
