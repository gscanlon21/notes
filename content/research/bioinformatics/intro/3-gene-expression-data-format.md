# Gene Expression Data Format

**Coding Strand**
: Matches the mRNA nucleotides (with U's instead of T's).

**Template Strand**
: Read by RNA Polymerase when it's creating the mRNA.


> [!NOTE]
> If you have a transcript of mRNA, you can map it back to the gene it came from based on the sequence.
> <br>
> You can sequence all the mRNA content in a cell, and use that to quantify the expression level of genes.[^1]
