# Title Casing

## Fixing Incorrect Capitalization
If you find that a title is incorrectly showing in title case in your bibliography, make sure that it is stored in sentence case in your Zotero library. You can automate part of the conversion into sentence case by right-clicking on the unselected title in the Info pane and choosing “Sentence case”. You will then need to manually capitalize any proper nouns. You only need to do this once, and then Zotero will always use the correct case for that item, no matter what citation style you're using.

It is also possible to prevent title casing of non-English titles.

## Sentence Case and Subtitles
Some styles that require sentence case, such as APA, also require that the first letter of the subtitle following a colon also be uppercase (“Age and environmental sustainability: A meta-analysis”). Zotero will automatically capitalize the subtitle for styles that require it. If the title contains multiple colons or dashes, store the main title (before the colon) in the Short Title field to indicate where the subtitle begins.
