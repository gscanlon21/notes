# Installation

## Equipment
- Spray Bottle
- Squeegee
- Finishing Squeegee
- Trimming Knife
- Tape Measure

## Installation Guide

- Fill a spray bottle with clean water.
- Add 8-15 drops of liquid dish soap into the spray bottle.
- Clean the window thoroughly.
- Remove the protective liner from the back of the film.
- Spray the back of the film.
- Position the film on the glass and systematically squeegee out the water.
- Trim off the excess film with the knife. Squeegee the edges dry by wrapping a paper towel over the edge of the finishing squeegee.

## Precautions
The surface to which the film will be applied should be very clean, free of dirt, dust particles and silicone. Make sure there are no dry spots on the film prior to placing it on the glass. _Wet the film as the liner is removed!_

## Tip to remove liner
To separate the liner from the film, take two pieces of adhesive tape and stick them opposite each other at one corner. Then, pull the two pieces of tape apart and the liner will separate from the film. The adhesive surface of the film will now be exposed. Wet this surface.
