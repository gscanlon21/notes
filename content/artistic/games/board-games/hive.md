# Instructions

## The Object of Hive
The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's Queen Bee whilst at the same time trying to stop you opponent from doing the same to you. The pieces surrounding the Queen Bee can be made up of a mixture of both your pieces and your opponent's. The first player to surround their opponent's Queen Bee wins.

## Preparation
Each player takes all 13 pieces of one color and places them face up in front of them.

## Playing the Game
Play begins with one player placing a piece from their hand to the center of the table and the next player joining one of their own pieces to it edge to edge. Players then take turns to either place or move one of their pieces.

## Placing
A new piece can be introduced into the game at any time. However, with the exception of the first piece placed by each player, pieces may not be placed next to a piece of the opponent's color.
