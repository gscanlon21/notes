# A Feast a Day

A Feast a Day is a weekly meal planning newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to cook.

## App

[Download the app](https://github.com/gscanlon21/a-feast-a-day/releases). App tokens are generated from the preferences page on the [website](https://afeastaday.com). 

The program [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) can be used for automatic updates. 

## Features

- Customize how many people you are cooking for and their servings sizes.
- Customize how long you want to see or hide recipes before they refresh.
- Customize how much each nutrient is being targeted. Meal plans are automatically adjusted to remove nutrient imbalances.
- Recipes are chosen from equipment you have access to â€” no recipes that require a blender if you don't have one.
- Optional health and cooking tips.
- Ignore unwanted recipes.

## Email Clients

Because of how the emails are formatted, we require support for [absolutely positioned elements](https://www.caniemail.com/search/?s=absolute).

### Supported Email Clients

- Fastmail

### Unsupported Email Clients

- Gmail (no support for `position: absolute;`)


## Why a Newsletter?

Other cooking apps require users to seek out recipes and keep track of what nutrients they need to build a complete meal. I find that reminder notifications are too easy to swipe away or disable when they arrive at inconvenient times. Opening a dedicated fitness app can also be intimidating or overwhelming. A Feast a Day sends at most one workout per day and utilizes your email client's features to remind you later, or pin the workout, so that it's always visible when you check your email.

However, emails have their limitations as well. A Feast a Day is geared towards people with busy schedules or people who aren't as inclined to optimize their meal planning to 100%.
