# Vinegar
Commercially produced vinegar very seldom goes bad.

**Wine Vinegar**
: These can get cloudy[^2] or develop sediment, and that's normal. 

**Distilled Vinegar**
: This should not get cloudy, there should be no live bacteria.

**Filtered Vinegar**
: These can develop cloudiness and still be perfectly safe.

**Unfiltered Vinegar**
: These come with a lot of solids, and that's perfectly normal.


# Honey
##### How to Liquify Crystallized Honey
Put the bottle in slightly hot water and it will liquify again.


# Chicken

##### How to Season a Chicken Breast
1. Pull the chicken out of the fridge 15–30 min before cooking so it can warm up to room temperature.
1. Get out Balsamic Vinegar, Cajun Seasoning, Paprika, Red Chili Pepper Flakes, Tarragon, Salt, and Pepper.
	- A knife is good to have out as well so you can use it to cut out any chicken abnormalities.
1. Mix together the spices in a small bowl. At least 1 teaspoon of spices for each chicken breast.
1. Unseal the chicken, douse with balsamic vinegar. Inspect the chicken for any abnormalities.
1. Sprinkle over the spices, covering both sides. Wash both hands and the spice bowl.


# Rice
Rinse your rice before cooking to remove foreign contaminants and surface starch.

**Jasmine**
_Long-Grain_
: High **fluffy**:sticky starch ratio.

**Basmati**
_Long-Grain_
: High **fluffy**:sticky starch ratio.

**Arborio**
_Short-Grain_
: High **sticky**:fluffy starch ratio.
: Good for making risottos.

##### Rice to Water Ratios[^1]
Use a 1:1 rice to water ratio with an extra half-cup of water for evaporation.

##### Water is Bubbling Over?
For starchy rice, try wiping oil around the walls of the pot to break up the starch bubbles.

[^2]: This is often a result of leaving live bacteria ("The Mother") in the vinegar, like live yogurt cultures.
