# Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.



## Backing Up a Repository

Use `git bundle` to create a full or partial backup of a repository. The bundle itself functions as a repository so you can restore by cloning the bundle or adding it as a remote.

```powershell
git bundle create backup.bundle --all
```

## Shrinking the .git Folder

Use `-f` to "drop all old deltas".

```powershell
git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250 #-f
```

##  git update-index<sup>[1]</sup>

### --skip-worktree
Useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file ever because developers should change it. For example, if the main repository upstream hosts some production-ready configuration files and you don’t want to accidentally commit changes to those files, --skip-worktree is exactly what you want.

### --assume-unchanged
Assumes that a developer shouldn’t change a file. This flag is meant for improving performance for non-changing folders like SDKs.

## Git push fails with 'missing tree'

Not sure what causes this, but one of two things will usually clear it up. `Fetch` first and then run `git push --no-thin` or `git gc --aggressive --prune=now`.


## Split Up a Large (feature) Branch

- Pull and make sure the feature branch is up-to-date with main.
- Checkout a new branch from the main branch.
- Merge the feature branch into the working tree.
- Unstage or discard unwanted changes and commit staged changes.
