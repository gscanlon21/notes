Before setting up or installing lightshot, turn off Print Screen Shortcut under Ease of Access Keyboard Settings, then install lightshot, it should register "prtscr" as default. Its working 101% fine at my end.

To turn off Print Screen Shortcut;

Step 1: Search for Ease of Access Keyboard Settings

Step 2: Find Print Screen Shortcut

Step 3: Turn off the toggle
