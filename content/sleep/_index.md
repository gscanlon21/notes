# Sleep Hygiene
- Stick to a schedule
- Keep the bed at a cool temp.
- Monitor eating and drinking before bed. 
    - Stop eating at least 2-3 hours before bed.
- Notice unhelpful thoughts about sleep and challenge them.
    - "I'll be a wreck if I don't sleep well" = "I might be drowsy, but I can push through"
- Stimulus Control - Only associate the bed with sleep
    - In bed stressing about not sleeping = the bed is associated with your stressing.
    - If not asleep in 30 minutes, get up and relax elsewhere for a while.
- Relaxation Techniques
    - Meditation
    - Deep breathing
- Light Exposure
    - Get early morning sunlight and limit artificial blue light at night to promote a healthy sleep/wake cycle.
