##### Eye Conditions That Can Be Improved with Vision Therapy[^1]
- Focusing Problems
- Depth Perception Problems
- Hand-Eye Coordination Problems
- Strabismus and Amblyopia

# Equipment

## Prism Lens

**Base-in**
Requires divergence.
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face towards your nose.
: The image is shifted outwards—towards the small end of the lens (the apex).
: - This requires your eyes to diverge and shift outwards as well to match and fuse the images.

**Base-out**
Requires convergence.
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face away from your nose.
: The image is shifted inwards—towards the small end of the lens (the apex).
: - This requires your eyes to converge and shift inwards as well to match and fuse the images.

## Brock String
TODO

> Use an Alpine Butterfly Loop Knot to create a back-stop for each bead threaded onto the string.
