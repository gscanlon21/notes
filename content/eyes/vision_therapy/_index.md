# Equipment

> [!NOTE]
> For vision therapy charts, see the subsections in the sidebar.


## Prism Lens

**Base-in**
Requires divergence.
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face towards your nose.
: The image is shifted outwards—towards the small end of the lens (the apex).
: - This requires your eyes to diverge and shift outwards as well to match and fuse the images.

**Base-out**
Requires convergence.
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face away from your nose.
: The image is shifted inwards—towards the small end of the lens (the apex).
: - This requires your eyes to converge and shift inwards as well to match and fuse the images.
