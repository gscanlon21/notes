# Equipment

## Prism Lens

**Base-in**
Diverging
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face towards your nose.

**Base-out**
Converging
: The thick end of the lens (the base) should face away from your nose.

## Brock String
TODO

> Use an Alpine Butterfly Loop Knot to create a back-stop for each bead threaded onto the string.


# Suboccipitals
Suboccipitals are intimately linked to your eye muscles. They help balance and stabilize tiny head movements that your eyes make when they move around.

## Diagnostic Testing
MRIs are good for imaging soft-tissue injuries (injured muscles, ligaments, and tendons).
