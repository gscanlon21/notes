# Night Blindness
Night blindness is not a disease in itself, however, it is often a symptom of an underlying retinal condition or extreme myopia (nearsightedness). The most common signs of night blindness include blurry or cloudy vision in low light, difficulty seeing objects in dim lighting, inability to see stars in the sky at night, seeing halos around lights, struggling to adjust vision when entering a dark room from a bright area, and excessive squinting at night. 

Yellow filters that absorb short, high energy blue wavelengths are typically used for night driving to help reduce glare.  

> Wearing vision-correcting glasses helps significantly with night vision.
