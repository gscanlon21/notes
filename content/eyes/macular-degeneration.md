##### Can Macular Degeneration Be Reversed with Natural Treatment?[^1]
- While age-related macular degeneration (AMD) cannot be reversed, early detection and treatment can help slow its progression.
- Certain supplements, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, zinc, lutein, and zeaxanthin, may help slow the progression of dry AMD to later stages or wet AMD, but they cannot cure or reverse the condition.
- Lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, managing weight, and eating antioxidant-rich foods, may help prevent AMD.

##### Is Red Light Therapy Good for Macular Degeneration?[^2]
- Red light therapy is being explored as a potential method to slow the progression of macular degeneration by stimulating cells in the eye with low-level light wavelengths.
- Studies suggest red light therapy may improve visual health, particularly in the early stages of dry age-related macular degeneration. Benefits may last around 6 months after treatment.
- While the FDA has approved one red light therapy system for dry age-related macular degeneration, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term safety and effectiveness of this treatment for various types of macular degeneration.
