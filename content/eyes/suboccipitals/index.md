# Suboccipitals
Suboccipitals are intimately linked to your eye muscles. They help balance and stabilize tiny head movements that your eyes make when they move around.

## Diagnostic Testing
MRIs are good for imaging soft-tissue injuries (injured muscles, ligaments, and tendons).

> Note that MRI contrast is toxic to the body.

### MRI Procedures
- Wear Clothes Sans Metal
- Wear Cotton Clothing
  - Some graphic shirts or shorts have metallic ink in them that will reduce the image quality.

### MRI Results
Original medical images are stored as DICOM files. The [RadiAnt DICOM Viewer](https://www.radiantviewer.com/) can view medical images.
