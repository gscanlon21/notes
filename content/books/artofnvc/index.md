# Nonviolent Communication
Your feelings come from your own needs, expectations, and perceptions. Other people’s words and actions might trigger feelings in you, but they cannot cause those feelings.

## Observe Without Evaluation
Separate observations from evaluations. Describe only what you can see or hear. Exclude your interpretations, analyses, or judgments.

> I noticed that you are tapping your foot.

> ~~Your foot is tapping off the beat of the music.~~

## Identify and Express How You Feel
Identify and express how you feel due to the observations. Be careful not to confuse your feelings with your thoughts or opinions.

> I feel annoyed.

> ~~You're being annoying.~~

## Identify and Express the Underlying Needs
Take emotional responsibility (rather than blaming others for how you feel), and identify the underlying needs or values that lead to your feelings.

> I need peace and quiet to study. 

> ~~You're interrupting my peace and quiet.~~

## Make Requests to Meet Your Needs
Now convey clear, specific requests that would satisfy your needs. Listen to specific feedback about others’ thoughts/feelings in response to what you’ve just shared.

> Can you please leave the room or stop tapping your foot?

> ~~For the love of god, stop tapping your foot.~~



# Emergency Empathy
Used to cool down a simmering situation. 
Helps make the other person feel heard, forces them to introspect to answer your question.

Ask a question about what the other person is feeling to try and understand their perspective.
Don't project your feeling onto the other person.

> Are you feeling frustrated because other people aren't listening to you?

> ~~You seem angry because you can't regulate your emotions.~~

> ~~You look tired because you haven't slept in days.~~
