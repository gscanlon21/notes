**The Battle Between Sci-Fi and Fantasy**
: With the advance of science, myths were sort-of lost to knowledge, because the real-world and magic have a clear well-defined boundary. The perceived realism that captivated people with old fantasy was greatly diminished. Science fiction helps bridge that border by providing that sense of realism to an otherwise far-fetched world, allowing reality and mythology to once again become fused, in worlds where fantasy and science fiction both exist.
