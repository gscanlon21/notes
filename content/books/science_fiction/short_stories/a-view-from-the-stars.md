**The Battle Between Sci-Fi and Fantasy**
: With the advance of science, myths were sort-of lost to knowledge, because the real-world and magic have a clear well-defined boundary. The perceived realism that captivated people with old fantasy was greatly diminished. Science fiction helps bridge that border by providing that sense of realism to an otherwise far-fetched world, allowing reality and mythology to once again become fused, in worlds where fantasy and science fiction both exist.

**The "Church" of Sci-Fi**
: The author talks about how Chinese science fiction often lacks a religious feeling that would add depth to the impressions of the universe. On a generation ship for example, myths of the ship's origin or destination, having been lost to a millennia of time, can be likened to believing in a religious destination. Without which, the universe is too easy to conceptualize and loses its grandeur.
