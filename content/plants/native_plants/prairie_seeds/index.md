# Seeding Dates
Plant mixes with forbs from Nov 15th to Mar 15th.

Plant mixes with a heavy grass content from April 1st to June 15th.


# Broadcast
Best if after the ground has frozen & thawed. You may need a carrier (e.g. sand, rice hulls, pellitized lime, or vermiculite) if you want to reduce the amount of seed your are sowing.

## General Tips
- Control weeds before planting.
- You want soil that's firm, but not compacted.
- Plant at depth 2x the seeds thickness or less than ⅛" deep.
- Spread seed lightly and fill back in if you're left with extra seed.
- Get direct seed-soil contact.
- Watering and fertilizer will mainly help the weeds. Don't do it!
