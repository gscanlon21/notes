# Benefits of Urban Trees[^1]
One of the greatest benefits that trees provide is their ability to improve water quality and decrease flooding by reducing the amount of water runoff rushing through storm drains and into creeks after a rainfall. Trees also:
- Make our homes worth more
- Clean the air
- Remove atmospheric carbon and other air pollutants and produce oxygen
- Cool homes and streets
- Save energy
- Conserve soil
- Provide food
- Provide homes for wildlife
- Provide wood
- Improve health
- Reduce violence
- Mark the seasons
- Reduce glare
- Hide ugly views
