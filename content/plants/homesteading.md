# Black Walnuts
1. Gather Black Walnuts when they are dry.
1. Wait for the walnuts to soften and brown.
	- Toss them if they start growing white stuff on them?
1. De-husk the walnuts by rolling them under your foot or another heavy object.
1. Clean the walnuts:
	1. Soak the walnuts in a bucket of water.
	1. Use a grill-brush attachment or manual scrub brush to clean the walnut shells.
1. Fully dry the walnuts out in the sun so they don't rot. 
1. Hang them in a cool, dry place with ample airflow for up to 6 months.
1. Use a walnut cracker to break open the walnuts and use some small snip-snip scissors to pick out the edible pieces.
