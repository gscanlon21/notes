# What Flowers to Press
- Flat flowers are best for pressing.

## Good Flowers
- Violets
    - They retain a nice deep blue color after pressing.

## Bad Flowers
- Irises
    - The flowers hold too much moisture causing mold growth.
    - When devoid of moisture, they become fragile and brittle.

# How to Press Flowers

1. Pick flowers when they are dry. 
    - Wet flowers will likely develop mold.
1. Press the flowers in a hard cover book.
    1. Set two paper towels on either side of a set of pages.
    1. Lay the flowers on top of one of the paper towels.
        - Can leave the stems on or pluck them off
        - Can pull the flower petals or press them individually or do them whole.
    1. Carefully close the book.
1. Lay a heavy weight (at least 20 lbs) on top of the book.
1. After 1 week, carefully open the book and remove the paper towels.
    - Leave the flowers in the book, now pressed against the pages.
    - Doing this will help prevent mold growth.
1. After 3-4 more weeks, the flowers should be dry enough to use.
