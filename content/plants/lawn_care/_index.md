## Pests


### Moles

M.E.B.S. - Mole Elimination Baiting Strategy.<sup>[1]</sup>

1. After identifying the mole runs (obvious), take a sharpened broomstick and poke a few holes in each exposing the tunnel the the surface. Ensure that you have not handled the pointy end so your scent is not on the end.

1. Mark each of those openings with a landscape staple straddling the hole. Tie a small flag at the staple bend so it is easy to see.

1. Wait until the next day and note what holes have been filled in, those are active runs. Remove all flags/staple holes that have not been filled in.

1. In each active run, punch in a new hole with the broomstick at your marker. Drop in a mole bait worm in the hole, victor and tomcat work good. Be sure to wear rubber gloves (scent again). Leave baited hole open.

1. Check again the next day, the active holes should be filled in and that would indicate that they ate the bait worm too.

1. Make note of the current runs, If any more appear, repeat as necessary. I’ve never had to do it more than twice.
Good luck!
