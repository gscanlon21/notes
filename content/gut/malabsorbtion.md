# Malabsorbtion
May be caused by low stomach acidity. 

## Hypochlorhydria: Low Stomach Acidity

To test for low stomach acidity:
- Mix Â¼tsp baking soda with 4oz of water on an empty stomach.
- Will typically belch in under 3-5 minutes. If greater than 5 minutes, it's likely stomach acidity is low.

A harsher way to test for low stomach acidity:
- Take 1 Betaine HCL pill (highly acidic, swallow whole) with a meal high in protein once a day.
- Increase by 1 pill every other day until heartburn or discomfort occurs. 

### Treatment
- Increase protein intake and lower carbs and fat to signal your stomach to produce more acid.
- Treat gut dysbiosis (bad bacteria) that may be harboring in your gut and limiting the acidity of the stomach.
- Take 1 less than the max tolerated Betaine HCL or similar (pineapple, Alpha-Lipoic Acid...) to increase stomach acidity. 
    - Reduce intake if stomach acidity returns to normal.
