# Healing the Gut
Start slow. Healing the gut is not quick.

Diversity is king. Eat a wide variety of _whole_ foods, especially colorful plants (aim for 30+ different plants/week!) for diverse fibers and polyphenols.

Aim for 30-50g+/day of (80% soluble / 20% insoluble) fiber to feed beneficial microbes & produce Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate. (sa. psyllium husk).

Reduce/eliminate: processed foods (pesticides, herbicides, ...), refined carbs, added sugar, artificial sweeteners, inflammatory fats.

## Prebiotic Foods
Eat a wide variety of foods high in oligosaccharides to feed the healthy keystone bacteria in your gut.

- FOS
    - Asparagus
    - Artichoke
- Inulin
    - Garlic
    - Onion
- Resistant Starch
    - Green Bananas
    - Cooled Potatoes/Rice
